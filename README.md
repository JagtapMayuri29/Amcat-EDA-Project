# Amcat-EDA-Project (Aspiring Minds Computer Adaptive Test)
Project Overview
This project involves performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Aspiring Minds Employment Outcome 2015 (AMEO) dataset.

#Objective

Perform exploratory data analysis on the dataset and gain insights.
Analyze salary trends across job roles, specializations, gender, and AMCAT scores.
Test claims made in research articles about salary trends for fresh graduates in certain job roles.

#Steps Involved

A]Data Import and Cleaning : Load the dataset, handle missing values, and ensure the correct data types for each variable.

B]Univariate Analysis:

  1]Identify relationships between different categorical and numerical variables.
  2]Analyze individual variables like salary, gender distribution, and specialization.
  3]Use histograms, boxplots, and count plots to visualize the distribution of these variables.

C]Bivariate Analysis:

  Analyze relationships between variables using scatter plots, pair plots, boxplots, and bar plots.
  Explore relationships between salary and factors like AMCAT scores, academic performance, and specialization.
  Examine the influence of gender on specialization and salary.

Outlier Detection: Identify outliers in salary and AMCAT scores using boxplots.

Discovered the relationships between numerical columns using Scatter plots, hexbin plots

Identified the patterns between categorical and numerical columns using boxplot, barplot, etc..

Identified relationships between categorical and categorical columns using stacked bar plots.

Research Questions:
Test salary trends for fresh graduates in specific job roles like Software Engineer, Programmer Analyst, etc.
Analyze if there is a relationship between gender and specialization.
Results & Key Insights
Salary Distribution:
Several outliers exist in the salary distribution, with a few candidates earning much higher than the rest.
Gender and Specialization:
Male candidates dominate specializations like Mechanical and Civil Engineering, while female candidates are more prevalent in Computer Science and Information Technology.
